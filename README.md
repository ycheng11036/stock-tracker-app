Hi, this is a stock market dashboard that I have build with the help of a tutorial. This is mainly for my learning purposes.

This is an AI-powered stock tracking and market insights web application built with Next.js, MongoDB, and Google Gemini AI.
This project combines real-time market data, AI-driven news summaries, and automated workflows to deliver a personalized investing experience â€” built for learning purposes and hands-on experimentation with modern full-stack tools.

- Integration of Inngest for automated workflows such as sending daily news summary
- Integration of Google Gemini to power AI driven news summaries so you don't have to search around
- BetterAuth for easier and and more secure authentication functionalities
- shadcn/ui for modern looking user interfaces
